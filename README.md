# @blamejs/stash

**A zero-dependency, ephemeral, crypto-agnostic content store for Node.js.**

Bytes in, a random-capability ref out, bytes out once and they're gone. No key
lives anywhere in the store, so no operator can be compelled to use one. No npm
runtime dependencies. No TypeScript. No build step.

You put bytes in. You get a ref back. You take the bytes out once, and they're
gone.

```js
import { Stash } from "@blamejs/stash";
import { MemoryBackend } from "@blamejs/stash/backends/memory";

const stash = new Stash({ backend: new MemoryBackend() });

const ref = await stash.push(ciphertext, { meta: { kind: "drop" } });
// 'v1_...' is 256 bits of random capability, never a content hash

const readable = await stash.apply(ref);   // digest-verified stream
await stash.drop(ref);                     // gone
```

## Why this store

- **It can't decrypt anything.** No method takes a key; no cipher primitive is
  imported anywhere in the tree, and CI proves it on every commit. A store that
  *chooses* not to decrypt is a promise; a store with nowhere for a key to live
  is an architecture. Encryption belongs to the layer above.
- **Refs are capabilities, not addresses.** `v1_` plus 32 random bytes,
  unguessable, never derived from content, so holding a suspect document never
  lets anyone probe whether it is stored. Ref validation is a strict whitelist
  that doubles as path-traversal defense.
- **Write-once, monotone lifecycle.** Every state change moves an entry closer to
  destruction. Read budgets only decrement, expiry only arrives, and nothing can
  argue an entry back from the brink. There is no `touch()`.
- **Fail-closed verdicts.** Every failure is a typed `StashError` with a frozen
  `.code`. No path returns a default in place of an answer, and no error message
  ever contains a ref, a `meta` value, or a path.
- **Zero dependencies.** Runtime *and* development. Node builtins only, ESM, no
  build step. `npm install @blamejs/stash` adds exactly one package.

## Install

```
npm install @blamejs/stash
```

Requires Node `>= 24.19.0`.

The package is authored in ESM (`import`), but a CommonJS project can consume it
with `require` on that Node floor, with no build step and no shim. The package
graph has no top-level await, so Node loads it synchronously under `require`:

```js
const { Stash } = require("@blamejs/stash");
const { MemoryBackend } = require("@blamejs/stash/backends/memory");

const stash = new Stash({ backend: new MemoryBackend() });
```

## What ships today

Every option `SPEC.md` defines is accepted and enforced. An unknown option is a
config-time `TypeError`.

### Moving bytes

`push`, `pop`, `apply`, `show`, `has`, `list`, `reconcilable`, `stats`, `verify`,
`store`, `tombstones`, `drop`, and `clear` all run against either backend,
unmodified. Size and a self-describing digest are computed as the bytes stream
through, and reads are digest-verified. The algorithm is chosen at construction
and defaults to `sha3-512`.

### Pop and read budgets

`pop(ref)` streams an entry and destroys it the instant the stream drains
cleanly. Two concurrent pops race on an atomic claim, so exactly one drains and
the other rejects `RefClaimed`.

`push(source, { reads: N })` gives an entry a finite read budget. A credit is
spent only on a full, digest-verified `apply` drain, so an abandoned or corrupted
read costs nothing. Concurrent budgeted readers serialize, so the last credit is
never double-spent, and the read that exhausts the budget destroys the entry.

A read that fails to drain is resolved by `onPopFailure`: restored for a retry by
default, or burned. On the disk backend, a claim abandoned by a process killed
mid-pop is reclaimed on the next construction, with `claimTimeout` setting the
grace window, and a drop during a live claim is monotone, so the entry never
comes back.

### Limits

`maxSize` bounds each entry and is checked as the bytes stream, so an oversized
or unbounded source aborts with `SizeExceeded` at the limit rather than filling
the disk.

`maxEntries` and `maxTotal` bound the whole store and refuse an over-budget push
with `StashFull`, without evicting anything already stored. Expired-but-unswept
entries are reaped before the store is judged full, and every rejected push
leaves no partial behind.

### Expiry

A construct-time `ttl` default (`'24h'`, `'7d'`, a number of milliseconds, or
`null`), overridable per `push`. An expired entry reads back as `RefNotFound` and
is dropped in passing, before any sweep.

`list()` hides expired entries by default, and `{ includeExpired: true }` reveals
them. `prune()` reaps on demand. `sweepInterval` arms an `unref()`'d background
sweep that never holds the process open, and `close()`, or `await using` via
`Symbol.asyncDispose`, stops it.

Terms are fixed at push and only ever move an entry toward destruction. There is
no touch or extend.

### Audit and events

`verify()` walks the store and reports physical damage: a bit-flipped blob, a
corrupt sidecar, an orphaned blob or half-written `.tmp`, a foreign file, a stale
claim, a corrupt tombstone. It re-hashes every blob with that blob's own
algorithm. It is a dry run by default; `verify({ repair: true })` removes only
what it condemns, sparing healthy entries, an in-flight `.tmp`, and a claim
recovery owns.

A `Stash` is an `EventEmitter`. It emits `'pushed'`, `'popped'`, `'dropped'`,
`'expired'` (exactly once per reaped entry), and `'sweepError'`, never the
process-killing `'error'`. It is also async-iterable. `has(ref)` is a boolean
existence check, and `stats()` returns `{ entries, bytes, claimed }`.

### Replication

`store(entry, source)` files an already-created entry with its identity intact.
The caller supplies the full `Entry` and it lands verbatim, with the bytes
verified against the supplied digest and size as they stream, so transfer
corruption is caught on the way in.

A malformed id, a tombstoned id, an already-expired entry, or a digest conflict
is refused before anything lands. An identical entry is an idempotent no-op, so
retrying a sync is free. A replicated entry honors the stash limits like a push:
one larger than `maxSize`, or past `maxEntries` or `maxTotal`, is refused rather
than slipping the capacity. Two concurrent stores of the same id are serialized,
so conflicting replicas cannot both land. `store` emits no event, so a sync
daemon never echoes its own writes.

Every early destruction (`pop`, `drop`, `clear`, a spent read budget) leaves a
tombstone of `{ id, destroyedAt, cause }`; expiry leaves none. `tombstones()`
returns them for reconciliation, and feeding each id to a replica's `drop()`
converges two stores with no resurrection. `tombstoneTtl` (default `'30d'`, or
`null` to never prune) reaps a grave once older than the window. Keep it above
the longest gap between reconciliations, or a forgotten grave lets an id come
back.

A sync reads its source with `reconcilable()` rather than `list()`. `list()`
fails the whole listing on one corrupt sidecar, which is right for an audit and
wrong for a sync, so `reconcilable()` returns the healthy `entries` to copy plus
the `corrupt` ref ids whose sidecars are unreadable, surfaced for
`verify({ repair: true })`. A single damaged entry never halts replication of the
sound ones.

### Digest agility

The integrity hash is a construct-time choice. `new Stash({ backend, digest })`
selects `sha3-512` (the default), `sha256`, `sha512`, `sha3-256`, or `shake256`,
all `node:crypto` builtins. This is integrity, not confidentiality; there is
still no encryption.

SHA-3 has no hardware acceleration where SHA-2 does, so the default hashes at
roughly a sixth of `sha256`'s rate, and the store hashes every byte on the way
in and again on every verified read. If that throughput matters more to you than
the algorithm choice, set `digest: 'sha256'` explicitly.

The stored digest is self-describing (`"algo:hex"`), so reads and `verify()` hash
with each entry's own algorithm and a store may mix algorithms. The default
leaves every existing store byte-identical.

### Backends

The disk backend (`@blamejs/stash/backends/disk`) keeps one blob and one JSON
sidecar per entry, so there is no central index to corrupt. It writes atomically
through tmp-fsync-rename, uses `0700` and `0600` modes, enforces realpath
containment that refuses planted symlinks instead of following them, and
validates sidecars under a strict size bound. Corruption is a typed
`IntegrityError`, never silently bad bytes and never a silent skip.

The in-memory backend implements the same contract, for tests and
process-lifetime stashes. One conformance suite runs against both, unmodified.

### A stable backend contract, and a way to certify against it

The `SPEC.md` section 9 backend interface is a public extension point. Any object
implementing its method set is a first-class backend, so a store this library
doesn't ship, such as an S3-compatible object store, a remote block device, or an
in-house key/value service, plugs into `new Stash({ backend })` with the network
and encryption kept in your layer.

`@blamejs/stash/conformance` exports `runBackendConformance(factory, { test })`,
the behavioral suite the in-tree backends pass. It drives the shipped consumer
path and asserts the frozen verdicts (`ENOREF`, `ECLAIMED`, `E2BIG`, `EFULL`). It
imports no test runner, so you wire your own, whether `node:test` or otherwise,
and prove your backend is interchangeable rather than reading prose:

```js
import { test } from "node:test";
import { runBackendConformance } from "@blamejs/stash/conformance";
import { MyBackend } from "./my-backend.js";

runBackendConformance({ name: "my-backend", create: () => new MyBackend() }, { test });
```

## The verbs

The moving verbs are `git stash`'s, with the same mental model; the rest are
queries and janitorial work. Every verb runs against either backend, unmodified.

| Verb | Does | Destroys? |
|---|---|---|
| `push(source, opts?)` | Store bytes; mint a random-capability ref. | no |
| `store(entry, source)` | File an already-created entry, identity preserved (replication). | no |
| `apply(ref)` | Stream an entry, digest-verified; a read budget spends one credit. | only on the budget-exhausting read |
| `pop(ref)` | Stream an entry, then destroy it the instant it drains cleanly. | yes |
| `show(ref)` | Resolve a ref to its metadata (never the bytes). | no |
| `has(ref)` | Boolean existence check. | no |
| `list(opts?)` | Every live entry's metadata (expired hidden by default). | no |
| `reconcilable()` | Reconciliation source read: healthy `entries` plus `corrupt` ref ids, so one damaged sidecar never halts a sync. | no |
| `stats()` | `{ entries, bytes, claimed }` for the whole store. | no |
| `tombstones()` | The graves `{ id, destroyedAt, cause }`, for reconciliation. | no |
| `verify(opts?)` | Audit physical integrity; `{ repair: true }` removes only what it condemns. | only under `repair` |
| `drop(ref)` | Delete an entry (and tombstone the id). | yes |
| `clear()` | Drop everything; return the count. | yes |
| `prune()` | Reap expired entries on demand. | yes (expired only) |
| `close()` | Stop the background sweep (also `await using`). | no |

## Error codes

Every operational failure, whether a bad ref, a missing entry, a corrupt blob, or
a full store, is a typed `StashError` with a frozen `.code`. Branch on the code,
never the message: messages improve between patches and codes do not (`SPEC.md`
section 10). No message ever contains a ref, a `meta` value, or a path.

Configuration mistakes are separate. An unknown option, or a source that isn't a
supported type, throws a native `TypeError` at the call, before any storage is
touched.

<!-- BEGIN error-codes (generated from src/errors.js by scripts/regen-readme.js) -->

| Code | Class | Raised when |
|---|---|---|
| `ENOREF` | `RefNotFound` | Unknown or expired ref. |
| `ECLAIMED` | `RefClaimed` | A concurrent pop already claimed the entry. |
| `EINTEGRITY` | `IntegrityError` | Blob bytes no longer match the recorded digest. |
| `E2BIG` | `SizeExceeded` | maxSize crossed mid-stream. |
| `EFULL` | `StashFull` | maxEntries / maxTotal reached; the push was refused. |
| `EBADREF` | `InvalidRef` | Malformed ref string; refused before any storage access. |

<!-- END error-codes -->

## Recipes

**Materialize an entry to a file, in one copy.**

```js
import { pipeline } from "node:stream/promises";
import { createWriteStream } from "node:fs";

// non-destructive for an unbudgeted entry: read a verified copy to the destination, entry stays put
await pipeline(await stash.apply(ref), createWriteStream(dest));
```

There is deliberately no `materializeTo(dest)` method. `apply` already returns a
digest-verified stream, so piping it to a destination is a single copy the store
never buffers, the bytes are verified end to end, it works against any backend,
and the write lands inside the caller's own filesystem grant. A store-side copy
would give up the digest-verified read, cross the write-scope boundary (the store
writes only within its own root), and only work on a filesystem backend.

On an entry with no read budget, `apply` is non-destructive, so a failed write
leaves the source intact to retry. On a read-budgeted entry it spends one credit
per full drain and the budget-exhausting drain destroys it, so a retry there
consumes another credit; run a materialization against unbudgeted refs.

To *move* an unbudgeted entry out of the store, materialize it with `apply` and
then `drop(ref)` once the write has durably landed. Never `pop` into a file: a
failed write would leave the entry destroyed and the file incomplete.

## Runnable examples

Each is a plain-node script, zero dependencies, runnable straight from a clone:

```
node examples/lifecycle.js         # push -> show -> apply -> pop -> gone; budgets; expiry
node examples/cold-standby.js      # replicate a store without resurrecting the dead
node examples/permission-flags.js  # run under --permission; prove the grant is scoped
```

They assert every step and run in CI, so a broken example fails the build.

## Command-line tool

Inspect and maintain a disk-backed stash from the shell without writing a Node
program. The `stashjs` command ships with the package:

```
npx @blamejs/stash verify --root ./.stash         # audit for damage; --repair to clean
npx @blamejs/stash stats --root ./.stash           # entries, bytes, claimed
npx @blamejs/stash list --root ./.stash --json     # entries as JSON, for scripting
npx @blamejs/stash prune                            # reap expired entries and old graves
npx @blamejs/stash tombstones                       # the graves left by destroyed entries
npx @blamejs/stash has <ref>                        # true / false
```

The root comes from `--root`, else `$STASH_ROOT`, else `./.stash`, and must
already exist. Add `--json` to any command for a machine-readable document.

The CLI exposes only the query and maintenance verbs. It never moves bytes and
never destroys by ref, so it hands out no capability and streams no blob. It
fails closed with stable exit codes and runs under `--permission` exactly as the
library does.

Point it at a stash whose owning process is stopped, or at a cold-standby
replica. Like every access to a disk root it is single-writer, and each command
except `verify` runs the crash-recovery scan first.

## Run it sandboxed

StashJS is designed to run under the Node permission model, with the WRITE grant
scoped to the store. The read grant spans the app directory, because Node loads
its module graph (your code and `node_modules`) from disk, while only the store's
directory is writable. Create that directory first: under the sandbox the backend
can fill it but not create it, which would need write on its parent.

```
mkdir -p .stash
node --permission --allow-fs-read=. --allow-fs-write=./.stash app.js
```

The Node permission model is a process-level filesystem allowlist, not per-module
isolation. It confines the whole process, StashJS and every dependency loaded
alongside it, to the granted paths, so a compromised dependency cannot reach the
wider filesystem, only the stash root and the app's own source. Code sharing the
process can still read the stash root, so run the stash in its own process to
isolate it from other code in the tree.

On Node 24.x, `--permission` does not gate the network; StashJS opens no sockets
regardless. The store never spawns child processes, never starts worker threads,
and never accepts a file descriptor as input, so no wider grant is ever needed.

## Versioning and support

The public surface is stable. Every verb, option, error code, and on-disk format
carries a semantic-versioning commitment: a breaking change ships a new major,
preceded by a deprecation warning at least one minor ahead
([MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md)), under the support window in
[LTS-CALENDAR.md](LTS-CALENDAR.md). `SPEC.md` is the contract.

The current major is `v2.x`. Upgrading from `v1.x` changes two error verdicts and
nothing else. There is no on-disk format change, so a `v1.x` store opens under
`v2.0` unmodified. `v2.0` is an exception to the deprecation rule above: it
shipped without a preceding deprecation minor, so read
[MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md) rather than relying on having been warned at
runtime.
