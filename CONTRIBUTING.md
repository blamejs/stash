# Contributing to @blamejs/stash

Thanks for considering a contribution. `@blamejs/stash` is a zero-dependency,
ephemeral, crypto-agnostic content store for Node.js with strong architectural
defaults, and this doc is the guide to making your patch land cleanly.
[SPEC.md](SPEC.md) is the authoritative specification; every design question is
settled there before it is settled in code.

## Quick links

- **Found a bug?** Open an issue with a minimal reproducer. For security bugs,
  **don't** open a public issue. Report privately via GitHub's
  ["Report a vulnerability"](https://github.com/blamejs/stash/security/advisories/new)
  form.
- **Have a feature idea?** Read [SPEC.md](SPEC.md) section 3 ("Do not build
  these") first. Several obvious improvements are deliberately rejected there,
  with reasoning. If your idea survives that list, open an issue to discuss the
  design before writing code.
- **Want to ship a fix?** Read [Development setup](#development-setup),
  [House rules](#house-rules), and [The PR loop](#the-pr-loop) below.

## Development setup

```bash
# 1. Clone. There is no install step: zero dependencies, including dev dependencies.
git clone https://github.com/blamejs/stash.git
cd stash

# 2. Run the test suite (node:test, no framework)
npm test

# 3. Run the static gates (CI runs all of them)
npm run gates   # codebase-patterns + comment-block validator + api-snapshot + status-lifecycle

# 4. Run the suite under the Node permission model, scoped to the test root
npm run test:sandboxed

# 5. Or run everything the way CI does, in one command
npm run smoke
```

Use `npm test` rather than a bare `node --test`. The script passes
`--expose-gc`, which one chaos vector needs to force a collection; without it
that vector silently skips, and on recent Node versions a bare directory
argument fails outright.

**Requirements:** Node.js 24.21.0 or newer (see `.node-version`). The library
targets that floor as a floor, not a ceiling: no polyfills, no compat shims, no
version branches for older runtimes. Nothing is transpiled, so what ships is
what runs.

## House rules

These are the project's hard rules. Patches that violate them get bounced
regardless of how clean the code is.

### SPEC.md is the contract

The spec is written first and the code follows it. A patch that changes
observable behavior either matches what SPEC.md already says, or arrives
together with the spec change and the argument for it. If a task seems to
require the store to understand the contents of a blob, the task is wrong: stop
and ask (SPEC.md section 1).

### Zero dependencies, including dev dependencies

Not one runtime dependency. Not one dev dependency. Node builtins only; tests
use `node:test` and `node:assert/strict`. If your change cannot be completed
without adding a package, open an issue rather than adding it. There is no
vendoring escape hatch here: the dependency count is zero, full stop.

### No cryptography beyond hashing and random IDs

`node:crypto` may be imported for `createHash`, `randomBytes`, and
`timingSafeEqual`, never `createCipheriv` or `createDecipheriv`. There is no key
parameter on any method and no place for one to live. The absence of the
capability is the product: a store with nowhere to put a key survives the threat
model "someone compels the operator". Encryption is the consumer's layer, not
this one.

### The do-not-build list

SPEC.md section 3 is load-bearing. No encryption, no content addressing or
dedup, no compression, no `node:sqlite` index, no content inspection, no HTTP
server, no cloud backends, no eviction, no TTL extension, no namespaces, no sync
transport, no logging of refs or metadata, no telemetry. Each entry has its
reasoning in the spec, and a PR that adds one of these will be closed with a
pointer to it.

### Fail loud, typed errors

Every failure surfaces as a typed error extending `StashError` with a stable
`.code` (`ENOREF`, `ECLAIMED`, `EINTEGRITY`, `E2BIG`, `EFULL`, `EBADREF`).
Consumers must never need to string-match a message. **No error message ever
contains a ref, a `meta` value, or a path**, because refs are capabilities and
error text is for developers. A default that silently degrades, whether evicting
to make room or accepting a malformed ref after "cleanup", is a bug rather than
an ergonomic.

### Streaming-first

No method may buffer an entire blob in memory. Size limits are enforced
mid-stream: count bytes as they pass and abort the moment a limit is crossed,
never write the whole thing and then check. A failed or rejected write leaves
nothing behind.

### The monotone rule

Entry lifecycle only moves toward destruction. `readsLeft` only decrements,
claims only resolve, expiry only arrives. Anything that would let an entry live
longer than its terms at push time is rejected on sight (SPEC.md section 4.2).
New terms mean a new push.

### Code style

- **ESM only.** `"type": "module"`, plain JavaScript. No TypeScript, no build
  step, no bundler. Consumers read the same source the runtime executes.
- **No child processes, no worker threads, no native addons, no WASI.** Each
  would widen the permission-model sandbox (SPEC.md section 2.1). Paths only,
  never a file descriptor as input.
- **Timers that must not hold the process open are `.unref()`'d.** The sweep
  timer is the canonical case.
- **Source files are pure ASCII.**

### Executable invariants

Two rules from SPEC.md section 13.1 are wired into CI as machine-enforced
checks, and your patch must keep them green:

1. Grepping the source for `createCipheriv`, `createDecipheriv`, `node:sqlite`,
   and `password` yields zero hits.
2. The full suite passes under `node --permission` with filesystem grants scoped
   to the test root only. If your change quietly requires a broader grant, the
   sandbox catches it at the point the change is made.

### Test coverage

Tests run with plain `node:test`, no framework. Backends share one conformance
suite run against every backend, so a new backend inherits the whole behavioral
contract. Its portable core ships as `@blamejs/stash/conformance`
(`runBackendConformance(factory, { test })`), so an out-of-tree backend
certifies against the same cases without cloning this repo, and the in-tree
suite runs the identical harness against the memory and disk backends.

The non-negotiable cases are enumerated in SPEC.md section 13: concurrency races
on `pop`, mid-stream aborts, crash recovery, traversal refs, symlink
containment, budget accounting, tombstone convergence.

New behavior lands with a test that **reproduces the failure first**, red on the
current tree and green on the fix, driving the real consumer path
(`stash.push(...)` or `stash.pop(ref)`, not a poked backend internal) with the
adversarial input that triggers it. Root-cause the whole class the bug samples,
not just the one input. Use `await using` for any test that needs a live
`Stash`.

### Documentation examples are executed

Every `@example` in a `src/` comment block is run by
`node scripts/run-doc-examples.js`, in CI and in the smoke pipeline. Parsing is
not enough: an example calling a method that was renamed, or passing an option
the code no longer accepts, compiles perfectly and is still wrong. So the gate
executes each body as a real ES module, in its own process, and the example is
proven only when that process exits 0. Import specifiers resolve through the
package's published `exports` map, so `@blamejs/stash/backends/disk` is checked
against what actually ships.

Most examples are one or two lines because they assume a store and a ref already
exist. `scripts/doc-example-world.js` defines that ambient state and is the list
of identifiers an example may use without declaring them: `stash`, `ref`,
`ciphertext`, `data`, `sink`, `backend`, `primary`, `replica`, `from`, `to`,
`bytesFor`. Anything else has to be declared or imported by the example itself.

There is no way to opt out. An example that does not run fails the build, and
one whose body is only prose, or only imports, fails too, because it never shows
the call it documents. If you hit a case where a documented call genuinely
cannot be executed here, raise it on the PR rather than working around the gate:
an exemption nothing can check is a skip list, and the answer is either a wider
example world or a narrower example.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Contributions are accepted under the
[Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/). By adding
a `Signed-off-by` line to each commit you certify that you wrote the patch, or
otherwise have the right to submit it, under the project's Apache-2.0 license.
Sign off with `git commit -s`, which appends
`Signed-off-by: Your Name <you@example.com>`. The sign-off must match the commit
author.

## The PR loop

1. **Open an issue first** for non-trivial work. Design discussion catches scope
   problems before code is written, and checks the idea against SPEC.md section
   3. Trivial fixes (typos, doc tweaks, single-line bug fixes) can skip the
   issue.
2. **Branch off `main`.** Branch name doesn't matter; we squash on merge.
3. **One concern per PR.** A new capability plus its tests plus its docs is one
   PR. A new capability plus an unrelated cleanup is two.
4. **Fail-loud verification before push:**
   - `npm test` passes.
   - `npm run gates` exits 0, so the structural detectors, comment-block
     validator, and api-snapshot are clean. Intentional public-surface changes
     regenerate the snapshot and commit it alongside the change.
   - `npm run test:sandboxed` passes, running the suite under `--permission`
     scoped to the test root.
   - `node scripts/run-doc-examples.js` exits 0, so every `@example` you touched
     still runs.
   - The section 13.1 greps are clean: no cipher imports, no `node:sqlite`, no
     `password`.

   `npm run smoke` runs all of the above in one command, and writes every
   child's full output to `.test-output/smoke.log`.
5. **Commit message style:** lowercase imperative. The first line is a
   one-sentence summary; the body explains *why* and *what tradeoff*, and cites
   the SPEC.md section that governs the behavior.
6. **Open the PR.** Wait for CI green.
7. **Review feedback** focuses on:
   - Does this match the spec, or does it need a spec change first?
   - Is every failure a loud, typed error, never a silent default and never a
     leaked ref in a message?
   - Does the lifecycle stay monotone?
   - Does the suite still pass under `--permission` with the same grants?

## What to contribute

**New here?** The highest-value contributions are adversarial tests: traversal
ref variants, concurrency races on claims and read budgets, mid-stream aborts at
unusual offsets, crash-recovery scenarios. The section 13 list is the map, and a
case on that list without a test yet is a ready-made first PR.

Good contribution areas:

1. **Adversarial test vectors.** Malformed refs, symlink plants, partial-write
   recovery, concurrent-pop and budget races.
2. **Coverage and hardening.** The SPEC.md section 12 delivery plan is complete,
   so the open work is deepening the tests around the shipped surface:
   uncovered branches, crash and chaos injection on the claim and
   tombstone-recovery paths, and fuzz-corpus growth on the untrusted-bytes
   parsers.
3. **Documentation and runnable examples.** Clearer prose, more runnable
   examples, and doc-correctness fixes against the shipped behavior.

What we don't want:

- Dependencies. Runtime or dev. Period.
- TypeScript ports or build steps.
- Anything on the SPEC.md section 3 list, however helpful it feels.
- A convenience default that papers over a real decision: silent eviction, TTL
  extension, or "cleaning up" a malformed ref instead of rejecting it.
