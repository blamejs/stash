 *   Every failure StashJS reports is a typed error with a stable `.code`.
 *   Consumers branch on the code, never on the message text -- messages are
 *   free to improve between patches; codes are frozen. All classes extend
 *   `StashError`, so `err instanceof StashError` separates a stash verdict
 *   from an unrelated bug.
 *
 *   One rule binds every message: it never contains a ref, a `meta` value,
 *   or a filesystem path. A ref is a capability, and an error that echoes a
 *   capability into a log file has leaked it. Messages describe the failure
 *   class; the caller already holds the identifiers it passed in.
 *
 * @card
 *   Typed error classes with stable codes -- the fail-closed verdict surface
 *   of the store.
