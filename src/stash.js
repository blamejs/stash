 * @order      10
 * @slug       stash
 *
 * @intro
 *   The policy layer of the store. `Stash` owns identity (refs), lifecycle,
 *   and integrity; the backend it wraps owns bytes. You put bytes in with
 *   `push` and get a ref back -- a 256-bit random capability, not a content
 *   address. You read them back with `apply`, inspect with `show` / `list`,
 *   and destroy with `drop` / `clear`.
 *
 *   The verb set is `git stash`'s, and the correspondence is the contract:
 *   lifecycle verbs the git command doesn't have don't get added, and the
 *   ones it has don't get renamed. Entries are write-once and their
 *   lifecycle is monotone -- every state change moves an entry closer to
 *   destruction, never further.
 *
 *   The store is crypto-agnostic by architecture: there is no key parameter
 *   on any method and no cipher import anywhere in the tree. Encryption
 *   belongs to the consumer; StashJS is a shelf.
 *
 *   A `Stash` is an `EventEmitter`. It emits `'pushed'` (Entry) after a push
 *   commits, `'popped'` (Entry) after a pop's delete lands, `'dropped'` (Entry)
 *   on `drop` / `clear` / a budget-exhausting read, `'expired'` (Entry) exactly
 *   once per reaped entry, and `'sweepError'` (Error) -- never `'error'`, which
 *   would crash the process -- when a background sweep throws. Payloads are full,
 *   defensive-copy Entry objects emitted after the change commits, so a throwing
 *   listener cannot unwind the committed operation.
 *
 * @card
 *   The policy layer -- push bytes in for a random-capability ref, stream
 *   them back out, destroy on demand; write-once entries, fail-closed
 *   verdicts.

 * @primitive  stash.Stash
 * @signature  new Stash(opts) -> Stash
 * @since      0.1.0
 * @status     stable
 * @spec       SPEC.md 4, SPEC.md 7, SPEC.md 7.1
 * @defends    CWE-1188
 * @related    stash.backends.MemoryBackend
 *
 * Construct a store over a backend. `opts.backend` is required and must
 * implement the backend contract (SPEC.md 9).
 *
 * `opts.ttl` (`'30m'`, `'24h'`, `'7d'`, a number of ms, or `null` for no
 * expiry) is the construct-time default expiry for every push, overridable per
 * call. `opts.sweepInterval` (same duration forms) arms a background `prune()`
 * timer. The timer is `.unref()`'d, so an open `Stash` never holds the process
 * open on exit, but still call `close()` or `await using` on shutdown, since an
 * unref'd timer keeps the `Stash` reachable. A `sweepInterval` of zero, or above
 * Node's ~24.8-day timer ceiling, is a config-time TypeError rather than a
 * silent busy loop.
 *
 * `opts.maxSize` bounds each entry (a size string like `'100mb'`, or a byte
 * count). A push that exceeds it aborts mid-stream with `SizeExceeded`, leaving
 * no partial behind. `opts.maxEntries` and `opts.maxTotal` bound the whole
 * store; a push that would exceed either is refused with `StashFull`, and
 * nothing existing is evicted to make room. Expired-but-unswept entries are
 * pruned before the store is judged full, so they never block a live push.
 *
 * A stats read and the write are not atomic, so concurrent pushes can overshoot
 * a stash-wide bound by the number in flight: the bound stops unbounded growth,
 * not that exact byte. `maxTotal` counts the stored footprint, each blob plus
 * its metadata, so many tiny blobs carrying large `meta` cannot slip past it. It
 * is a ceiling you set rather than one the disk enforces, so size it below the
 * backing partition's free space, and keep `maxSize` at or below it, or the
 * filesystem fills before the limit fires.
 *
 * `opts.onPopFailure` decides what happens to an entry whose `pop`, or budgeted
 * `apply`, fails to fully drain, whether through a stream destroyed early, a
 * source error, or a digest mismatch. `'restore'` (the default) returns the
 * entry so the read can be retried; `'burn'` destroys it anyway.
 *
 * `opts.claimTimeout` (a duration string or a number of ms, default `'10m'`,
 * strictly POSITIVE) is how long a claim left by a crashed process is treated as
 * still live before recovery reclaims it on the next construction. A claim
 * younger than this is left untouched. Recovery NEVER reclaims a claim a live
 * reader in THIS process is still draining: single-writer-per-root means the
 * process tracks its own live claims, so the age test, and the wall clock behind
 * it that a forward step can jump, is consulted only for an ORPHAN with no live
 * holder, meaning a crashed prior run's. Set it to comfortably exceed the
 * longest `pop` or budgeted read, and keep a disk root to a single writing
 * process. A non-positive `claimTimeout` is refused at construction.
 *
 * `opts.tombstoneTtl` (a duration string, a number of ms, or `null` to never
 * prune; default `'30d'`) is how long a destruction's grave is kept before
 * pruning. Size it above the longest gap between replica reconciliations, or a
 * forgotten grave lets an id come back.
 *
 * `opts.digest` picks the integrity hash for new pushes: `'sha3-512'` (the
 * default), `'sha256'`, `'sha512'`, `'sha3-256'`, or `'shake256'`. The stored
 * digest is self-describing, so a read verifies with the entry's OWN algorithm
 * and one store may mix them. SHA-3 is not hardware-accelerated where SHA-2 is,
 * so the default trades throughput for its algorithm choice; `'sha256'` buys the
 * throughput back.
 *
 * Every option this constructor accepts is enforced; an unknown one is a
 * config-time TypeError.
 *
 * @example
 *   import { Stash } from "@blamejs/stash";
 *   import { MemoryBackend } from "@blamejs/stash/backends/memory";
 *
 *   const stash = new Stash({ backend: new MemoryBackend(), ttl: "24h" });

   * The replication-grade insert (SPEC.md 4.4): file an already-created entry,
   * preserving its identity where `push` mints a new one. The caller supplies the
   * COMPLETE `Entry` -- `id`, `createdAt`, `expiresAt`, `reads`, `readsLeft`,
   * `digest`, `meta` -- and it lands verbatim; the bytes are verified against the
   * supplied `digest` and `size` as they stream, so transfer corruption is caught
   * on the way in and nothing lands. It proceeds in a normative order:
   *
   *   1. a malformed id is `InvalidRef`, before any storage access;
   *   2. a tombstoned id returns `false`, writing nothing -- a destroyed id never
   *      comes back;
   *   3. an entry already past its `expiresAt` is a no-op `false` (the dead travel
   *      as dead, and get no grave);
   *   4. an identical live entry (same id, same digest) is an idempotent no-op
   *      `false`, so a retry-based sync is free;
   *   5. same id, different digest is an `IntegrityError` -- corruption, not a
   *      merge; the existing entry is untouched;
   *   6. otherwise it writes exactly like `push`, every field the caller's, and
   *      returns `true`.
   *
   * A genuinely new entry (past step 5) is charged against the stash bounds exactly
   * as a `push` is: a replica larger than `maxSize` aborts `SizeExceeded`, and one
   * past `maxEntries` / `maxTotal` is refused `StashFull` -- replication input does
   * not get to slip the configured capacity. Concurrent stores of the SAME id are
   * serialized so two conflicting replicas cannot both land (the loser sees the
   * winner and reconciles: idempotent-`false` or an `IntegrityError`).
   *
   * `store` emits NO event: a sync daemon that heard its own writes would echo them
   * back forever, so the silence removes that bug class here rather than in every
   * caller. The replicated entry is untrusted input -- a shape violation, a digest
   * that is not a well-formed `<algo>:<hex>` for a registry algorithm, an incoherent
   * read budget, or a non-plain `meta` is an `IntegrityError`, never a partial write.
   *
   * A read budget is enforced per store, so two replicas of a `reads: 1` entry can
   * each serve one full read before their tombstones converge -- exactly-once
   * becomes eventually-once. Serve reads from a single node (cold standby) unless
   * that weaker guarantee is a deliberate choice.
   *
   * @example
   *   for (const e of await primary.list()) await replica.store(e, bytesFor(e.id));
