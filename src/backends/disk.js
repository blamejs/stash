 * @since      0.1.1
 * @status     stable
 * @spec       SPEC.md 9, SPEC.md 2.1, RFC 8259
 * @defends    CWE-22, CWE-59, CWE-367, CWE-377, CWE-770, path traversal (CWE-23)
 * @related    stash.backends.MemoryBackend, stash.Stash
 *
 * Construct the sidecar-file disk backend over `opts.root`. The layout is
 * `blobs/<id>` + `meta/<id>.json`, plus the claims and tombstones directories
 * the pop cycle and replication use; directories are mode 0700, files 0600, and
 * there is no central index to corrupt (a listing is a readdir plus sidecar
 * reads). Writes stream to a `.tmp`, fsync, then rename, so a reader never sees
 * a partial blob and a crash leaves an invisible orphan, never a half-entry.
 * The constructor does no I/O; the layout appears on first use.
 *
 * Containment is the backend's own job, not the sandbox's: the root is
 * realpath-pinned at init, every operation re-asserts that its directory still
 * resolves inside it, and a symlink where a blob belongs is refused rather than
 * followed. Reads verify the descriptor they draw from, so no path is
 * re-resolved between the check and the read.
 *
 * @example
 *   import { Stash } from "@blamejs/stash";
 *   import { DiskBackend } from "@blamejs/stash/backends/disk";
 *
 *   const stash = new Stash({ backend: new DiskBackend({ root: "./.stash" }) });
