 *
 * @intro
 *   The storage layer, behind one contract (SPEC.md 9): the backend holds
 *   bytes, `Stash` holds policy. A backend never validates lifecycle, never
 *   interprets `meta`, and never decides destruction. It stores what it is
 *   handed under the id it is handed, computes size and the digest as the
 *   bytes stream through (with the algorithm named by the entry's
 *   self-describing digest), and reports what it holds. The same conformance
 *   suite runs against every backend, unmodified.
 *
 *   Two implementations ship. The memory backend is Map-backed, for tests and
 *   process-lifetime stashes. The disk backend is sidecar-file storage: one
 *   blob and one JSON sidecar per entry, no central index to corrupt, atomic
 *   tmp-fsync-rename writes, 0700/0600 modes, and realpath containment that
 *   refuses a planted symlink instead of following it.
 *
 * @card
 *   The storage contract and both shipped backends: Map-backed memory, and
 *   sidecar-file disk with atomic writes and realpath containment.

 * @signature  new MemoryBackend() -> MemoryBackend
 * @since      0.1.0
 * @status     stable
 * @spec       SPEC.md 9
 * @related    stash.Stash
 *
 * Construct the in-memory backend. Pass it as `backend` to `new Stash()`.
 * Storage is a private Map from id to `{ entry, chunks }`; nothing touches
 * the filesystem.
 *
 * A `claim` (the pop cycle, SPEC.md 6) moves the entry into a separate claims
 * Map with no `await` between the "already claimed?" check and the move, so
 * on the single-threaded event loop that move ITSELF is the atomicity two
 * concurrent pops race on: the first wins, the second gets `RefClaimed`.
 * `restore` returns a claim to the live map, `commit` destroys it, and
 * `verify` reports a claim older than `claimTimeout` as stale without
 * repairing it.
 *
 * The claims Map lives only in this process's heap, so a claim dies with the
 * process and nothing persists for a later run to reclaim: there is NO
 * cross-process crash recovery here. Reach for the disk backend when a claim,
 * or the data, must survive a restart.
 *
 * @example
 *   import { Stash } from "@blamejs/stash";
 *   import { MemoryBackend } from "@blamejs/stash/backends/memory";
 *
 *   const stash = new Stash({ backend: new MemoryBackend() });
 *   const ref = await stash.push("hello");
